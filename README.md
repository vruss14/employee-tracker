# Employee Tracker

## Description

This application utilizes Node.js and MySQL to allow a user to create and modify information about employees within a particular organization. By answering questions in the command line, the user can add new departments, roles, and employees, as well as view departments, roles, and employees. If desired, the user can also update a particular employee's role. To create this application, I used Node.js, MySQL, inquirer, and additional npm packages as needed.

This application was challenging for me to create. I learned a lot about syntax in MySQL to ensure that each query would not result in any errors. I also learned how to use functions for choices in inquirer rather than using simple arrays. Overall, I grew a lot from developing this application.

I see many opportunities for future development for this project, including:

- Adding more opportunities for deletion
- Adding more opportunities for updating data
- Adding more queries to view a subset of departments/roles/employees

I am excited to continue to implement what I have learned in future projects.

## Installation

For this application to run correctly, run ```npm init -y ``` in the working directory of your choice. Next, install the relevant dependencies by running ```npm i```. Alternatively, you can install the dependencies one at a time.

Please note that it may take a few minutes for all dependencies to download on your local machine. 

To start the application from the command line after installations have been complete, run the seed.sql file in MySQL Workbench and then run ```node index.js```.
